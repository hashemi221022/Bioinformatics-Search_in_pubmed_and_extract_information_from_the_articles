      "BACKGROUND: Photoreceptor (PR) enriched retinal organoid (RO) sheets (human embryonic stem cell [hESC]-derived ROs) resulted in restoration of visual acuity in immunocompromised retinal degenerate (RD) animal models after transplantation. Further assessment of their clinical potential requires evaluation in immunocompetent RD disease models with effective immune suppression. We characterized safety and efficacy profiles of both donor tissues and prospective immunosuppressive treatments in vitro; and in vivo in immunocompetent RD rats (strain SD-foxn1 Tg(S334ter)3Lav).\n",
      "METHODS: Retinal identity of ROs was validated by histology, flow cytometry and gene expression profiling, and their immunogenicity to sensitized human immune cells was measured by mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLR). We measured the effect of RO exposure for 1-4¬†weeks to therapeutic concentrations of our immunosuppressant drugs of choice on gene expression and metabolic function using quantitative PCR (qPCR) and functional and structural fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM), respectively. Immunocompetent RD graft recipients were immunosuppressed by implanted tacrolimus (TAC) pellets and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in food. In vivo, LCMS aided assessments of drug pharmacodynamics. Flow cytometry immunophenotyping and assay of post-surgery cytokines were used to assess and monitor drug efficacy. Retinal transplants were imaged in situ using optical coherence tomography (OCT) at defined time points post-surgery. Visual function was assessed by optokinetic tests (OKT) and superior colliculus electrophysiology recording. At study endpoints, immune cell infiltration and donor photoreceptor engraftment into host retinal architecture was evaluated by immunohistochemistry.\n",
      "RESULTS: Immunosuppressive drugs have no negative effects on RO development and metabolism in vitro; and low alloreactivity of ROs determined by MLR may be predictive to that of human graft recipients. In vivo, minimum effective dosing ranges of TAC and MMF were determined. We characterized the mechanisms and critical immune populations implicated in rejection; and subsequently demonstrated their effective suppression in our xenograft RD model. OKT measured significant visual improvement after RO transplantation. Transplants developed most retinal cell types including photoreceptors; and integrated with the host retina. However, immunosuppression induced higher sensitivity to ketamine anesthesia.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: This study proves the concept that immunosuppression is likely tolerable in retinal transplantation and human stem cell therapy for retinal degeneration patients.\n",

      "No Label: Human myoblasts (hMb) are a promising source for engineering skeletal muscle tissue. But sample-specific variabilities make research with human cells challenging. For the purpose of selecting hMb with adequate proliferation and differentiation properties, the influence of various patient related factors, including age, gender, BMI, anatomical sampling site and previous radio-/chemotherapy on hMb behavior was investigated in this study. Immunofluorescence staining and proliferation periods were analysed for proliferation capacity, while creatine kinase and cell viability assay, immunofluorescence staining and PCR were used to determine differentiation capacity. Using desmin expression, a multiple linear regression (MLR) model was established based on the above-mentioned patient related factors. Higher age and BMI, female gender and chemotherapy had a negative impact on desmin expression. Muscle type specific differences could also be seen. Previous radiotherapy led to senescence of hMb in large parts. Differentiation was mainly influenced by gender in a time-dependent manner, as well as by the anatomical collecting site. We were able to demonstrate the importance of analyzing patient characteristics for the purpose of hMb isolation. Using MLR, these patient characteristics can be used to predict the proliferation capacity of hMb as a step further towards translational application of skeletal muscle engineering and regeneration.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Olfactory epithelial stem cells hold significant potential for treating olfactory dysfunction by facilitating tissue maintenance and repair. Understanding the inherent qualities of these stem cells is crucial for optimizing their therapeutic efficacy.\n",
      "METHODS: Olfactory epithelial samples were collected from patients with deviated nasal septum (DNS) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). These were cultured to form olfactory neurospheres (ONS), which were then analyzed for neural stem cell markers, neurotrophic factor production, and their ability to differentiate into olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs). The regenerative efficacy of these ONS was tested in a methimazole-induced hyposmic mouse model, with the effects on cellular senescence, apoptosis, and proliferation in the olfactory epithelium assessed.\n",
      "RESULTS: Both DNS- and CRS-derived ONS exhibited neural stem cell characteristics. DNS-ONS displayed superior self-renewal capacity and higher neurotrophic factor production compared to CRS-ONS, which showed impaired OSN maturation and lower neurotrophic factor levels. In vivo, DNS-ONS were more effective in restoring olfaction, as evidenced by reduced cellular senescence, decreased apoptosis, and increased cell proliferation in the OE of methimazole-induced hyposmic mice.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the importance of selecting the appropriate ONS source for therapeutic applications, with DNS-ONS showing greater promise for olfactory epithelium repair and olfactory function restoration.\n",

      "No Label: Ubiquitylation of H2A (H2AK119ub1) by the polycomb repressive complexe-1 plays a key role in the initiation of facultative heterochromatin formation in somatic cells. Here we evaluate the contribution of sperm derived H2AK119ub1 to embryo development. In Xenopus laevis we found that H2AK119ub1 is present during spermiogenesis and into early embryonic development, highlighting its credential for a role in the transmission of epigenetic information from the sperm to the embryo. In vitro treatment of sperm with USP21, a H2AK119ub1 deubiquitylase, just prior to injection to egg, results in developmental defects associated with gene upregulation. Sperm H2AK119ub1 editing disrupts egg factor mediated paternal chromatin remodelling processes. It leads to post-replication accumulation of H2AK119ub1 on repeat element of the genome instead of CpG islands. This shift in post-replication H2AK119ub1 distribution triggered by sperm epigenome editing entails a loss of H2AK119ub1 from genes misregulated in embryos derived from USP21 treated sperm. We conclude that sperm derived H2AK119ub1 instructs egg factor mediated epigenetic remodelling of paternal chromatin and is required for embryonic development.\n",

      "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a multifactorial and highly prevalent disease in elderly adults; however, its pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment are unmet needs nowadays. Research efforts have focused on elucidating the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis, onset, and progression of OA to facilitate early detection and effective therapeutic approaches. Infrapatellar fat pad (IPFP) represents a promising novel source of OA biomarkers given that it is an active player in OA. This review aims to investigate the current literature regarding the potential of the IPFP as a source of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for OA as well as potential target for novel therapies.\n",
      "METHODS: A literature search was conducted in the PubMed database in June 2024. We included cross-sectional and longitudinal studies based on IPFP from human OA patients, oriented in the identification of imaging, biochemical, and molecular biomarkers in the IPFP.\n",
      "RESULTS: After screening and evaluation, we included a total of 61 studies. Most of the imaging publications (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ47) on IPFP are based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that revealed potential semiquantitative and quantitative imaging biomarkers linked to inflammation, fibrosis, pain, and joint degeneration imaging parameters. Biochemical and molecular studies (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ14) pointed out an increase in interleukin-6 (IL-6), fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4), adiponectin, and lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC) in the IPFP during OA progression.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Imaging, biochemical, and molecular studies indicate OA potential biomarkers in the IPFP related to inflammation, lipid dysregulation, and fibrosis. The combination of imaging and biochemical biomarkers could provide a better prediction of OA onset and the identification of OA progressors at an early stage. The IPFP study could also reveal potential therapeutic targets with the vision of better precision medicine.\n",

Photobiomodulation (PBM) is a non-invasive physical therapy that induces changes in the intrinsic mechanisms of cells and tissues through low-power light exposure. Although PBM has been employed in the treatment of AD, the effect and precise mechanism of PBM on AD-induced neurological damage are still unclear.\n",
      "METHODS: In vivo experiments, PBM (808¬†nm, 20 mW/cm\n",
      "RESULTS: PBM further ameliorates AD-induced cognitive impairment by alleviating neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis, thereby attenuating nerve damage. In addition, PBM can also reduce neuroinflammation by promoting microglial anti-inflammatory phenotypic polarization; Promotes AŒ≤ clearance by enhancing the ability of microglia to engulf AŒ≤. Among them, PBM regulates microglial polarization and inhibits neuronal apoptosis, which may be related to its regulation of mitochondrial energy metabolism, promotion of oxidative phosphorylation, and inhibition of glycolysis.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: PBM regulates neuroinflammatory response and inhibits neuronal apoptosis, thereby repairing AŒ≤-induced neuronal damage and cognitive dysfunction. Mitochondrial energy metabolism plays an important role in PBM in improving nerve injury in AD mice. This study provides theoretical support for the subsequent application of PBM in the treatment of AD.\n",

      "OBJECTIVES: The heterogeneity and phenotype of immune cells orchestrate many physiologic and pathologic processes. Recent evidence suggests that immune cells play critical roles in the progression of osteoarthritis (OA). We hypothesised that injury and obesity, two major risk factors for OA, affect the immunophenotype of the synovium, the primary reservoir of immune cells in the joint.\n",
      "METHODS: Using single-cell transcriptomics, immunoprofiling, transgenic mouse models, and genetic fate mapping methods, we characterised the presence and fate of multiple populations of immune cells found in the knee joint capsule.\n",
      "RESULTS: We found that joint injury and obesity differentially and synergistically alter the architectural, cellular, and molecular profiles of the synovial capsule. We observed fewer patrolling monocytes in obese animals and found a significantly higher influx of proinflammatory monocyte-derived macrophages in the first 3 days after joint injury in obese compared with that in control animals. We also showed a significant loss of barrier-forming synovial lining macrophages 3 days after destabilisation of medial meniscus surgery, with a significant restoration of their numbers in normal weight but not in obese mice in advanced stages of OA. Finally, we characterised the presence and changes of other immune cell subtypes, including T, B, and mast cells and neutrophils, as well as local synovial fluid cytokines associated with injury and obesity.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Our data revealed that injury and obesity independently and synergistically contribute to the dysregulation of the synovial immune landscape, providing new insight into their role in the pathogenesis of OA.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: The autonomic nervous system (ANS) plays a key role in regulating tumor development and therapy resistance in various solid tumors. Within the ANS, the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is typically associated with protumor effects. However, whether the SNS influences the antitumor efficacy of intratumoral injections of oncolytic herpes simplex virus (oHSV) in solid tumors remains unknown.\n",
      "METHODS: In this study, we examined SNS innervation and its interaction with immune cell infiltration in both human and murine triple-negative breast cancer models during intratumoral oHSV injections and SNS blockade on oHSV's antitumor activity.\n",
      "RESULTS: Intratumor oHSV injection promotes SNS innervation accompanied by CD45+cell infiltration in both the human MDA-MB-468 orthotopic model and the murine 4T1 mammary tumor model. Mechanistically, tumor-secreted factors vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-Œ≤) and transcription factors (CREB, AP-1, MeCP2, and REST), which promote SNS innervation, were found to be upregulated in oHSV-treated tumors. Combining the SNS antagonist, a Œ≤-blocker, with oHSV significantly increased immune cell infiltration, particularly CD8+T cells in oHSV-treated 4T1 tumors. Single-cell messenger RNA sequencing revealed that oHSV injection upregulated a specific population of perivascular macrophages (pvMacs) expressing high levels of VEGFA, CD206, CCL3, and CCL4, which suppress T-cell activation. The use of a Œ≤-blocker reduced the infiltration of oHSV-induced pvMacs, transition to inflammatory macrophages expressing Hexb, enhancing the diversity of T-cell receptor clonotypes. Further analysis suggested that TGF-Œ≤ signaling within the tumor partially mediates SNS activation in the 4T1 model.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that combining a Œ≤-blocker with oHSV significantly enhances the antitumor efficacy of oHSV in breast cancer by targeting TGF-Œ≤-mediated SNS innervation and immunosuppression.\n",

      "INTRODUCTION: Long-term inflammatory microenvironment further impairs the healing process of diabetic wounds. Many studies have shown that Lactobacillus can regulate immune function and promote injured tissue repair. However, the immunomodulatory function and safety of Lactobacillus biofilm (LB) on wounds need further investigation.\n",
      "OBJECTIVES: In this present research, we proposed a \"bacteria-free biofilm derivative therapy\" and successfully extracted Lactobacillus biofilm derivatives (LBDs) by ultrasonic separation and filtration technology for the natural and safe treatment of diabetic wounds.\n",
      "METHODS: The study first cultured Lactobacillus anaerobically and extracted LBDs using ultrasound separation combined with filtration technology. LBDs were characterized via scanning electron microscopy, Concanavalin A fluorescence staining, and protein gel electrophoresis. In vivo diabetic wound model, wound closure rates were dynamically monitored, and tissue sections were analyzed using hematoxylin-eosin and immunofluorescence staining to evaluate LBDs' healing effects. An in vitro macrophage inflammation model was established, employing immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, and Western blotting techniques to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying LBDs' effects on macrophage phenotypes. Furthermore, whole-genome sequencing and proteomics of LBDs-treated macrophages were performed to further elucidate the intrinsic molecular mechanisms through which LBDs regulate macrophage phenotypes.\n",
      "RESULTS: LBDs were effectively extracted utilizing ultrasonic separation coupled with filtration technology. Studies revealed that LBDs modulate the systemic metabolic reprogramming in wound-site macrophages, suppress JAK-STAT1 signaling pathway, alleviate the local inflammatory microenvironment, promote neovascularization and ultimately accelerate wound healing.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The LBDs retains most bioactive components of the LB. As a natural, safe and immunomodulatory agent, LBDs promote diabetic wound healing by metabolically reprogramming macrophage phenotypes and improving the local immune microenvironment, offering promising potential for regenerative applications in diabetic wound management.\n",

      "No Label: Administration methods of macromolecular drugs with high efficacy and minimal side effects are generally limited to highly invasive injections due to their components and large molecular weight. Here, we propose a sequential ultrasonic irradiation method using multi-frequency for minimally invasive administration of macromolecular drugs. In this demonstration, low-frequency ultrasound (kHz band) and high-frequency ultrasound (MHz band) were sequentially irradiated onto the porcine skin to evaluate the dosing efficiency using fluorescence-modified ovalbumin (Mw‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ45‚ÄØkDa), a macromolecular drug model. Quantitative evaluation of the transdermal dosage by fluorescence intensity measurement shows that the proposed method significantly increased the transdermal dosage by almost double that of the conventional method. In particular, the distance of MHz ultrasonic irradiation is indicated to influence the dosing efficiency. In addition, the evaluation of transdermal permeability by confocal observation of skin sections shows that the macromolecular drug model penetrates through the epidermis of porcine skin, including the stratum corneum, to the dermis layer with the proposed method. The proposed method permeated the drug model with a behavior correlated to the intensity of the MHz ultrasonic beam, as opposed to the discrete penetration of the drug model in the conventional method. Our results provide a minimally invasive method of administering macromolecular drugs as an alternative to injection.\n",

      "METHODS: A systematic review was conducted by screening the most important scientific databases. The search included the keywords: (microbiome) OR (microbial) OR (bacteria) OR (bacterial profile) AND (urine) OR (urinary) AND (first-morning sample) OR (first void). Only original studies in English involving human specimens were considered.\n",
      "RESULTS: Of the 760 articles initially identified, a final sample of 20 original studies met the inclusion criteria. Disruptions in the urobiome composition were associated with increased colonization by pathogens such as Escherichia coli and Mycoplasma genitalium, resulting in inflammation and recurrent urinary conditions. Advanced diagnostic techniques, including metaproteomics, metagenomics, and point-of-care assays like NG-LFA, demonstrated enhanced capabilities for rapid pathogen detection and differentiation of inflammatory conditions. Therapeutic interventions targeting urobiome dysbiosis, particularly probiotics (Lactobacillus rhamnosus, L. reuteri, L. crispatus), showed promising efficacy in reducing recurrence and inflammation in clinical trials.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: Urobiome dysbiosis plays a critical role in inflammatory urinary tract disorders. Innovative diagnostic methods and targeted therapeutic approaches, especially probiotics, offer substantial potential to improve patient outcomes.

      "No Label: Pentraxin-3 (PTX3) is a secreted protein with roles in the stabilisation of hyaluronan-rich extracellular matrices involved in reproductive biology and inflammatory processes, as well as additional functions in innate immunity and cancer. Our recent structural studies (Shah et al., 2025; DOI:10.1016/j.matbio.2025.01.002), involving X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) and AlphaFold modelling, have provided clues as to how PTX3 becomes assembled into an octamer from eight identical protomer subunits. Here it was proposed that four protomers initially form a tetramer, composed of a highly extended N-terminal region consisting of coiled-coil structures and C-terminal pentraxin domains, where two tetramers then immediately align and associate via an extensive network of salt bridges, allowing stabilisation of the octamer via the formation of disulphide bonds. However, a paper published around the same time provides an alternative perspective (Guo et al., 2025; DOI: 10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2024.139207). The authors propose, based on cryoEM analyses, that in addition to octamers, stable dimers, tetramers and hexamers of PTX3 can also assemble, where it is the dimers that provide the 'building blocks' for generation of the various oligomeric forms. In this commentary we suggest that the presence of dimers, tetramers and hexamers is likely an artefact of the construct used in recombinant expression, since the existence of these oligomers is not consistent with other studies on PTX3. We also provide a model to clarify how protomers become assembled into an octamer via sequential formation of a disulphide-linked tetramer, non-covalent association of two tetramers through aligned ionic interactions and the formation of disulphide bonds between the C-terminal pentraxin domains.\n",

The expression of autophagy-related proteins, including LC3-II, p62, and Beclin-1, was analyzed using western blotting. To evaluate cell survival and regenerative capacity, the expression of TERT protein was examined. We further assessed the formation of autophagic vesicles using flow cytometry.\n",
      "RESULTS: SHED cells were positive for CD44 and CD73, while negative for CD31 and CD34. Differentiation assays demonstrate the ability of SHED cells to differentiate into osteoblasts and adipocytes. The MTT indicate an optimal concentration of 20‚ÄØŒºM chrysin, potentially showing enhanced cell proliferation. Western blot analysis revealed increased expression of LC3-II and Beclin-1, as autophagy-related protein following chrysin treatment, while a significant decrease was observed in the level of p62 (****P‚ÄØ<‚ÄØ0.0001). TERT levels showed a slight decrease in treated group. Chrysin significantly increased the autophagic vesicles, as evidenced by thr percentage of MDC-positive cells (**P‚ÄØ<‚ÄØ0.001). Chrysin also induced slight apoptosis in SHED cells(*P‚ÄØ<‚ÄØ0.05).\n",

However, the use of bidirectional barbed polydioxanone filament (BBPF) for this purpose remains underexplored. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the impact of a new muscle enhancement and support therapy (MEST) involving the insertion of a BBPF into the vastus medialis obliquus (VMO) to improve the symptoms of knee OA.\n",
      "METHODS: In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind study, we evaluated 131 patients over 40 with Kellgren-Lawrence grade II-III medial compartment knee OA. Of these, 88 received BBPF insertion into the VMO (MEST group), and 43 were in the control group. We compared pain levels (via a visual analog scale (VAS) during weight-bearing and walking), quadriceps muscle strength (IMCSQ), Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), and Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC), assessing outcomes before and after the procedure.\n",

Functional assays using si-RNA knockdown of CCNB1 and PLK1 were performed to assess their roles in cell proliferation.\n",
      "RESULTS: CCNB1, PLK1, and HPSE are upregulated in breast tumors at the mRNA and protein levels. CCNB1 and PLK1 promote tumor growth and metastasis, while HPSE is linked to immune pathways. DNA methylation in BRCA correlates with prognosis, with PLK1 alterations protective for recurrence-free survival. High expression of these genes worsens prognosis, with CCNB1 as a risk factor for overall survival. Immune infiltration analysis associates these genes with tumor-infiltrating immune cells, highlighting HPSE's immunotherapeutic potential. Single-cell RNA sequencing confirms CCNB1 and PLK1 drive malignant proliferation and an immunosuppressive environment. Functional assays demonstrated that silencing CCNB1 and PLK1 significantly reduced breast cancer cell proliferation, indicating regulatory interactions among PLK1, CCNB1, and MKI67.\n",

      "No Label: Many neurological diseases involving tissue damage cannot be treated with drug-based approaches, and the inaccessibility of human brain samples further hampers the study of these diseases. Human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), including embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), provide an excellent model for studying neural development and function. PSCs can be differentiated into various neural cell types, providing a renewal source of functional human brain cells. Therefore, PSC-derived neural cells are increasingly used for multiple applications, including neurodevelopmental and neurotoxicological studies, neurological disease modeling, drug screening, and regenerative medicine. In addition, the neural cells generated from patient iPSCs can be used to study patient-specific disease signatures and progression. With the recent advances in genome editing technologies, it is possible to remove the disease-related mutations in the patient iPSCs to generate corrected iPSCs. The corrected iPSCs can differentiate into neural cells with normal physiological functions, which can be used for autologous transplantation. This review highlights the current progress in using PSCs to understand the fundamental principles of human neurodevelopment and dissect the molecular mechanisms of neurological diseases. This knowledge can be applied to develop better drugs and explore cell therapy options. We also discuss the basic requirements for developing cell transplantation therapies for neurological disorders and the current status of the ongoing clinical trials.\n",

      "No Label: Guanosine triphosphate (GTP) is a building block for DNA and RNA, and plays a pivotal role in various cellular functions, serving as an energy source, enzyme cofactor and a key component of signal transduction. The activity of the rate-limiting enzyme in de novo GTP synthesis, inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), is regulated by nucleotide binding. Recent studies have illuminated that IMPDH octamers can assemble into linear polymers, adding another dimension to its enzymatic regulation. This polymerisation reduces IMPDH's sensitivity to the inhibitory effects of GTP binding, thereby augmenting its activity under conditions with elevated GTP levels. Within cells, IMPDH polymers may cluster to form the distinctive structure known as the cytoophidium, which is postulated to reflect the cellular demand for increased GTP concentrations. Nevertheless, the functional significance of IMPDH polymerisation in in vivo metabolic regulation remains unclear. In this study, we report the widespread presence of IMPDH cytoophidia in various human cancer tissues. Utilising the ABEmax base editor, we introduced a Y12C point mutation into IMPDH2 across multiple cancer cell lines. This mutation disrupts the polymerisation interface of IMPDH and prevents cytoophidium assembly. In some cancer xenografts, the absence of IMPDH polymers led to a downregulation of IMPDH, as well as the glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathways. Furthermore, mutant HeLa-cell-derived xenografts were notably smaller than their wild-type counterparts. Our data suggest that IMPDH polymerisation and cytoophidium assembly could be instrumental in modulating metabolic homeostasis in certain cancers, offering insights into the clinical relevance of IMPDH cytoophidium.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the luteinization process and steroidogenic differences between granulosa cells from small antral and preovulatory follicles in vitro.\n",
      "DESIGN: Granulosa-lutein cells were obtained from 12 women undergoing IVF treatment, while follicular granulosa cells from unstimulated small antral follicles and corpus luteum were collected from 18 women undergoing ovarian tissue cryopreservation. Cells were cultured for up to 96 hours or 12 days with or without androstenedione or testosterone supplementation and analyzed using RT-qPCR and steroid hormone assays.Setting: University Hospital of Copenhagen, Denmark, and Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine, USA.\n",
      "RESULTS: In follicular granulosa cells, luteinization markers (CYP11A1, p<0.05; STAR, p<0.001) increased within 24-48 hours, while granulosa markers (HSD17Œ≤1, p<0.001; CYP19A1, p<0.05) decreased within 6-12 hours. LHCGR remained unchanged. By 48 hours, gene expression resembled that of the corpus luteum. In contrast, granulosa-lutein cells exhibited highly luteinized profiles from day 0, with significantly higher progesterone/(17)estradiol ratios. Androgen supplementation and long-term FSH exposure did not alter luteinization.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: This study uniquely demonstrates that unstimulated follicular granulosa cells undergo a gradual, intrinsic luteinization process, independent of external hormonal triggers. In contrast, granulosa-lutein cells are already highly luteinized upon aspiration. These findings challenge conventional views on luteinization and highlight intrinsic cellular programming as a key driver, offering new insights into ovarian physiology and potential therapeutic targets for reproductive disorders.\n",

      "No Label: Dendritic spine abnormalities are believed to be one of the critical etiologies of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Over the past decade, the importance of microglia in brain development, particularly in synaptic elimination, has become evident. Thus, microglial abnormalities may lead to synaptic dysfunction, which may underlie the pathogenesis of ASD. Several human studies have demonstrated aberrant microglial activation in the brains of individuals with ASD, and studies in animal models of ASD have also shown a relationship between microglial dysfunction and synaptic abnormalities. However, there are very few methods available to directly assess whether phagocytosis by human microglia is abnormal. Microglia are tissue-resident macrophages with phenotypic similarities to monocyte-derived macrophages, both of which consistently exhibit pathological phenotypes in individuals with ASD. Therefore, in this study, we examined the phagocytosis capacity of human macrophages derived from peripheral blood monocytes. These macrophages were polarized into two types: those induced by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF MŒ¶, traditionally referred to as \"M1 MŒ¶\") and those induced by macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF MŒ¶, traditionally referred to as \"M2 MŒ¶\"). Synaptosomes purified from human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neuron were used to assess phagocytosis capacity. Our results revealed that M-CSF MŒ¶ exhibited higher phagocytosis capacity compared to GM-CSF MŒ¶, whereas ASD-M-CSF MŒ¶ showed a marked impairment in phagocytosis. Additionally, we found a positive correlation between phagocytosis capacity and cluster of differentiation 209 expression. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the pathobiology of ASD and offers new insights into potential therapeutic targets for the disorder.\n",

Anatomical structures were removed from the surface layers in that order, and the dissection was shifted to the deeper layer. This approach makes it difficult for medical and dental students to understand the relationships among various anatomical structures.

      "No Label: Uveitis is a group of vision-threatening inflammatory diseases, and current treatment options are mainly limited to corticosteroids, which often have side effects and do not address the underlying immune dysregulation. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells cultivated in vitro have gained attention for their immune-regulating, neurotrophic, and tissue-regenerative properties, making them a promising candidate for treating uveitis. This study investigates the safety and efficacy of human umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (HUMSCs) combined with a novel suprachoroidal microinjector for targeted delivery in a rabbit model of experimental uveitis (EU). No significant clinical or histological changes were observed following HUMSCs injection in normal Chinichilla rabbit eyes. In the EU model, treatment with HUMSCs and triamcinolone acetonide (TA) significantly alleviated uveitis symptoms compared to phosphate-buffered saline, with notable improvements in anterior chamber inflammation and vitreous opacity scores. Both treatments also reduced the levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-Œ±, VEGF, MIP-1Œ±, IL-17A, bFGF) in the aqueous humor. Histological and immunofluorescence analyses showed decreased inflammatory cell infiltration and microglial activation. Additionally, RNA sequencing revealed that HUMSCs injection downregulated key genes in the Th17 differentiation pathway, which plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of EU. These findings establish the safety and efficacy of suprachoroidal injection of HUMSCs, highlighting their potential as an effective, targeted therapeutic approach for uveitis, with results comparable to TA.\n",

      "No Label: In current drug delivery strategies, the efficiency of most carriers still largely depends on their ability to passively infiltrate target tissues. To overcome this limitation, we developed monocyte-adhesive peptidyl liposomes, termed monocyte-mediated drug carriers (MMDCs). These carriers are designed to exploit the innate chemotactic properties of monocytes, which actively home to diseased tissues. MMDCs were shown to effectively hitchhike on circulating monocytes (THP-1 cells) under physiological flow conditions. Their targeting specificity was further demonstrated in a 3D microfluidic culture system consisting of human breast cancer spheroids (MDA-MB-231) embedded in a collagen matrix, overlaid with a human endothelial cell-derived barrier. MMDCs underwent trans-endothelial migration via monocyte hitchhiking and selectively recognized collagen matrices containing MDA-MB-231 cells, but not those embedded with non-cancerous cells. In vitro assays revealed that doxorubicin encapsulated in MMDCs was released into the extracellular environment following phagocytosis of the carriers by THP-1-derived macrophages. In a xenograft mouse model, MMDCs exhibited high tumor-targeting efficiency. By harnessing the homing capability of monocytes, MMDCs significantly improved drug biodistribution at the disease site, thereby enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of the encapsulated agents.\n",

      "No Label: 3D printing domain has witnessed rapid advancements with immense applications in various fields ranging from aerospace to 3D printed organs. This study describes a facile biofabrication approach for creating an Artificial blood vascular network inside the Hydrogel matrix by using Isomalt sugar (Sugar Alcohol) as a sacrificial component inside a composite-Hydrogel matrix. Conventional 3D-printers have extruder and hot-end assembly, whereas Bioprinters use pneumatic-piston, and piezoelectric-driven extrusion mechanisms. In this study, we describe the design and operation of a custom-made miniature precision lead screw-based syringe-pump extruder mechanism with integrated temperature-controlled heat-block. We are currently using this integrated setup for melt Isomalt-based 3D printing, which can be easily mounted over the Z-axis and is driven using a geared stepper motor with high torque, providing controlled extrusion of highly viscous polymers where sugar structures are used as sacrificial materials for making Artificial blood vascular like networks in the microfluidics domain within the composite Hydrogel matrix. Computational studies using COMSOL Multiphysics were performed to predict the diffusion pattern of the DMEM culture medium to estimate the rate of mass flow through a porous media. Furthermore, Cell based testing is performed using Human Adipose Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (HAD-MSC's) which were cultured over the vascular Hydrogel matrix perfused with culture media with defined flowrates to mimic the natural function of the Nutrient and gaseous exchange inside human tissues. The proposed can be used to produce equivalent Tissue models which could be potentially used in On-chip drug testing platforms, drug discovery and regenerative medicine domains.\n",

      "BACKGROUND: Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a rare, congenital disease characterized by the absence of enteric ganglia in the hindgut. Common genetic variation contributes substantially to the heritability of the disease yet only three HSCR-associated loci were identified from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) thus far.\n",
      "METHODS: We performed the largest multi-ancestry meta-analysis of GWAS to date, totalling 1250 HSCR cases and 7140 controls. Prioritized candidate genes were further characterized using single-cell transcriptomic data of developing human and mouse gut for their roles in development of enteric nervous system (ENS). Functional characterisation using human cells and zebrafish models was performed. Global and ancestry-matched polygenic risk score (PRS) models were derived and evaluated for predicting risk of HSCR.\n",
      "FINDINGS: We identified four HSCR-susceptibility loci, with three loci (JAG1, HAND2 and ZNF25) reaching genome-wide significance and one putative locus (UNC5C) prioritized by functional relevance. Spatiotemporal analysis revealed hotspots of gene dysregulation during ENS development. Functional analyses further demonstrated that knockdown of the candidate genes impaired cell migration and zebrafish knockouts displayed abnormal ENS development. We also demonstrated comparable performance for a PRS model derived from multi-ancestry meta-analysis to those of ancestry-matched PRS models, supporting its potential clinical application in risk prediction of HSCR across populations.\n",
      "INTERPRETATION: Overall, the meta-analysis implicated novel genes, pathways and spatiotemporal developmental hotspots in the genetic aetiology of HSCR. Development of a PRS universally applicable irrespective of ancestries may leverage its clinical utility in risk prediction.\n",

The case that the authors present in this paper concerns the corpse of a young woman who had already been autopsied, then treated with 20¬†% neutral buffered formaldehyde, a preserving agent, to enable its intercontinental transport, and then autopsied again. At the judge's request, a second judicial autopsy was performed in order to verify the cause of death and to carry out genetic investigations. As fresh tissue was not available to perform the genetic analysis, three different tissue matrices were taken: retina, liver, and iliopsoas muscle. The biological matrices taken were chosen as they were considered less likely to be in contact with formaldehyde and therefore probably less prone to artifacts caused by the action of formalin on the DNA structure. All three biological matrices were used to obtain a genetic profile. In particular, the genetic data obtained from the retina was found to be better than the genetic profile obtained from the iliopsoas muscle. In turn, the genetic profile obtained from the iliopsoas muscle was found to be better than the genetic data obtained from the liver sample.\n",

      "No Label: Delaying senescence of cardiomyocytes has garnered widespread attention as a potential target for preventing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). FGF13 (Fibroblast growth factor 13) has been implicated in various pathophysiological processes. However, its role in premature myocardial aging and cardiomyocyte senescence remains unknown. Adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9) vectors expressing FGF13 and cardiac-specific Fgf13 knockout (Fgf13KO) mice are utilized to reveal that FGF13 overexpression and deficiency exacerbated and alleviated Doxorubicin/D-galactose-induced myocardial aging characteristics and functional impairment, respectively. Transcriptomics are employed to identify an association between FGF13 and Caveolin-1 (Cav1). Mechanistic studies indicated that FGF13 regulated the Cav1 promoter activity and expression through the p38/MAPK pathway and nuclear translocation of p65, as well as the binding level of PTRF to Cav1 to mediate cardiomyocyte senescence. Furthermore, Cav1 overexpression in murine hearts reversed the alleviatory effects of FGF13 deficiency on the Doxorubicin/D-galactose-induced myocardial aging phenotype and dysfunction. This study has demonstrated that FGF13 regulated the Cav1-p53-p21 axis to augment cardiomyocyte senescence and thereby exacerbated cardiac premature aging and suggests that FGF13 knockdown may be a promising approach to combat CVDs in response to aging and chemotoxicity.\n",

Especially for breast cancer, current imaging-based screening methods suffer from high false positive rates for women with breast nodules, leading to unnecessary biopsies, which add to discomfort and healthcare burden. Here, we enrolled 613 female participants in this multi-center study and demonstrated that cfDNA fragmentomics (cfFrag) is a robust non-invasive biomarker for breast cancer using whole-genome sequencing. Among the multimodal cfFrag profiles, the fragment size ratio (FSR), fragment size distribution (FSD), and copy number variation (CNV) show more distinguishing ability than Griffin, motif breakpoint (MBP), and neomer. The cfFrag model using the optimal three fragmentomics features discriminated early-stage breast cancers from benign nodules, even at a low sequencing depth (3√ó). Notably, it demonstrated a specificity of 94.1% in asymptomatic healthy women at a 90% sensitivity for breast cancers. Moreover, we comprehensively showcased the clinical utilities of the cfFrag model in predicting patient responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and in combining with multimodal features, including radiological results and cfDNA methylation features [with area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.93-0.94 and 0.96, respectively].\n",

The actor-partner interdependence model revealed the direct impact of the patients' and caregivers' social support and hope level on their own family resilience. The indirect effect of the caregivers' social support on the patients' family resilience, in which the caregivers' hope level plays a significant mediating role.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: The family resilience of patients with recurrent cancer and their caregivers is affected by the level of social support and hope. In order to help patients and caregivers better cope with the disease, it is recommended that clinical medical staff pay attention to improving the social support and hope level of disease treatment of patients and caregivers, and regard the two as a community, and explore intervention programs focusing on improving family resilience.\n",

      "No Label: HIV-1 infection leads to metabolic changes in macrophages, yet a comprehensive understanding of its pathogenesis remains limited. To address this, we integrated transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses to uncover intracellular metabolic alterations in HIV-1-infected macrophages. We identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using RNA-sequencing, while metabolomic profiling was performed with UHPLC-QE-MS. The integration of transcriptomics and metabolomics was achieved through \"Joint Pathway Analysis,\" and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was used to validate the identified pathways. Our transcriptomic analysis revealed a total of 890 DEGs, comprising 424 downregulated and 466 upregulated genes in macrophages infected with HIV-1. KEGG enrichment analysis highlighted the biosynthesis of amino acids and glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism as significantly enriched (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05). RT-qPCR results confirmed the expression of key genes, including PHGDH, PSAT1, PSPH, CBS, CTH, and AOC2, associated with these pathways. From the metabolomic analysis, we identified 60 differential metabolites, with glycerophospholipids representing the majority (51.67%). The integrated analysis revealed significant changes in glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and linoleic acid metabolism in HIV-1-infected macrophages. This study offers an extensive overview of metabolic alterations in HIV-1-infected macrophages, which may enhance our understanding of the pathogenesis and highlight potential therapeutic targets.\n",

      "No Label: Tissue-engineered heart valves (TEHVs) are promising valve replacements due to their potential to regenerate into living heart valves, capable of growth and adaptation. Previous TEHVs showed promising results, but often developed progressive leaflet retraction in the long term. In a prior proof-of-concept study, we demonstrated that a novel geometry with more native-like mechanical behavior could give rise to more adaptive remodeling, thereby minimizing leaflet retraction in vivo. In the current study, we aimed to systematically analyze the impact of TEHV geometry on in vivo remodeling under both pulmonary and aortic conditions. Using a bio-inspired in silico framework, we predicted cell-driven, mechano-mediated remodeling in TEHVs post-implantation. Two parameterized valve designs were evaluated under both pulmonary and aortic pressure conditions. The results indicate that a valve design with smooth leaflets, a curved belly profile, and medium to wide attachment edge effectively minimizes stress concentrations and reduces the risk of valve insufficiency in both conditions. Additionally, this design should be tailored to specific hemodynamic conditions to prevent retraction in pulmonary applications and excessive stress concentrations in aortic applications. These insights provide essential guidelines for optimizing TEHV designs, aiming to promote functional remodeling and maintain valve functionality over time, thereby advancing the development of next-generation TEHVs with enhanced long-term outcomes.\n",

      "No Label: Aging-related bone degeneration and impaired healing capacity remain significant challenges in regenerative medicine, necessitating innovative, efficient, and targeted strategies to restore bone health. Here, we engineered extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from the serum of pretreated juvenile mice, with the goals of reversing aging, enhancing osteogenic potential, and increasing bioavailability to rejuvenate the aging bone environment. First, we established bone healing models representing different phases of healing to identify the EV type with the highest potential for improving the bone microenvironment in older individuals. Second, we employed DSS6 for bone targeting to enhance the biological effects of the selected EVs in vivo. The engineered EVs effectively targeted bone repair sites and promoted fracture healing more effectively than unmodified EVs in older mice. RNA sequencing revealed that the translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 7 (Tomm7) is crucial for the underlying mechanism. Silencing Tomm7 significantly diminished the positive regulatory effects of the EVs. Specifically, the engineered EVs may enhance mitochondrial function in aging cells by activating the Tomm7-mediated Pink1/Parkin mitophagy pathway, promoting stemness recovery in aging bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) and reversing the adverse conditions of the aging bone microenvironment. Overall, the developed engineered EVs derived from serum from juvenile mice offer an alternative approach for treating aging bones. The identified underlying biological mechanisms provide a valuable reference for precision treatment of aging bones in the future.\n",

      "OBJECTIVES: Non-dystrophic myotonias (NDM) are rare diseases due to mutations in the voltage-gated sodium (Nav1.4) and chloride (ClC-1) channels expressed in skeletal muscle fibers. We provide an up-to-date review of pharmacological treatments available for NDM patients and experimental studies aimed at identifying alternative treatments and at better understanding the mechanisms of actions.\n",
      "METHODS: Literature research was performed using PubMed and ClinicalTrial.gov.\n",
      "RESULTS: Today, the sodium channel blocker mexiletine is the drug of choice for treatment of NDM. Alternative drugs include other sodium channel blockers and the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide. Preclinical studies suggest that activators of ClC-1 channels or voltage-gated potassium channels may have antimyotonic potential.\n",

      "AIMS: The highly conserved long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) MIR505HG has been primarily recognized as a precursor for microRNAs (miR)-424 and miR-503. However, studies have since demonstrated that MIR503HG has distinct functions from its associated miRNAs, playing important roles in cell proliferation, invasion, apoptosis, and differentiation. While these miRNAs are known to influence cardiomyocyte differentiation, the specific role of MIR503HG in heart development remains unexplored. We seek to determine how MIR503HG deletion impacts ventricular chamber development and to identify underlying molecular mechanisms.\n",
      "METHODS AND RESULTS: To study the role of the lncRNA in vivo, we generated a functional MIR503HG knockout mouse model (MIR503HG-/-) using a synthetic polyadenylation signal to terminate MIR503HG transcription without affecting miR-424/503 expression. We performed morphological analyses on embryonic and adult hearts using microCT along with cardiac functional analysis via transthoracic echocardiography. We further apply single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) on adult hearts to identify potential molecular mechanisms underlying the observed phenotypes. Functional deletion of MIR503HG alone was associated with reduced compact myocardium thickness and increased trabecular myocardium in the left ventricle (LV) at embryonic day 17.5 compared to wild-type mice, indicating a LV non-compaction (LVNC) phenotype. Moreover, adult MIR503HG-/- mutant hearts showed increased trabecular complexity, impaired LV relaxation, and mitral valve regurgitation. SnRNA-seq further revealed altered expression of several genes associated with cardiomyocyte function and LVNC, including Actc1, Mib1, Mybpc3, and Myh7. Lastly, Notch1 activity was also significantly increased in mutant hearts which has been previously associated with LVNC.\n",
      "CONCLUSION: MIR503HG plays a role in ventricular chamber development, and its deletion leads to an LVNC phenotype independent of the miRNA cluster within its locus, highlighting its importance in cardiac development and disease. We further suggest that abnormal Notch1 activity may underpin the LVNC phenotype presented.\n",

      "No Label: The SORL1 gene encodes the sortilin-related receptor protein SORLA, a sorting receptor that regulates endo-lysosomal trafficking of various substrates. Loss of function variants in SORL1 are causative for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and decreased expression of SORLA has been repeatedly observed in human AD brains. SORL1 is highly expressed in the central nervous system, including in microglia, the tissue-resident immune cells of the brain. Loss of SORLA leads to enlarged lysosomes in hiPSC-derived microglia-like cells (hMGLs). However, how SORLA deficiency contributes to lysosomal dysfunction in microglia and how this contributes to AD pathogenesis is not known. In this study, we show that loss of SORLA results in decreased lysosomal degradation and lysosomal enzyme activity due to altered trafficking of lysosomal enzymes in hMGLs. Phagocytic uptake of fibrillar amyloid beta 1-42 and synaptosomes is increased in SORLA-deficient hMGLs, but due to reduced lysosomal degradation, these substrates aberrantly accumulate in lysosomes. An alternative mechanism of lysosome clearance, lysosomal exocytosis, is also impaired in SORL1-deficient microglia, which may contribute to an altered immune response. Overall, these data suggest that SORLA has an important role in the proper trafficking of lysosomal hydrolases in hMGLs, which is critical for microglial function. This further substantiates the microglial endo-lysosomal network as a potential novel pathway through which SORL1 may increase AD risk and contribute to the development of AD. Additionally, our findings may inform the development of novel lysosome and microglia-associated drug targets for AD.\n",
